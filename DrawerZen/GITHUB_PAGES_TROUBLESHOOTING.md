# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ‚úÖ Build process working locally
- ‚úÖ Webpack configured for GitHub Pages
- ‚úÖ .nojekyll file present
- ‚úÖ Correct publicPath set in webpack
- ‚è≥ Waiting for deployment

## Expected Site URL
https://ajaxrobinson.github.io/DZInternalTesting

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Status
1. Go to: https://github.com/AjaxRobinson/DZInternalTesting/actions
2. Look for the latest "Deploy static content to Pages" workflow
3. Check if it's:
   - ‚úÖ Completed successfully (green checkmark)
   - üîÑ Currently running (yellow circle)
   - ‚ùå Failed (red X)

### 2. Verify GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/AjaxRobinson/DZInternalTesting/settings/pages
2. Ensure:
   - Source: "GitHub Actions" is selected
   - NOT "Deploy from a branch"

### 3. Check Repository Permissions
Your repository might need to be **public** for GitHub Pages to work with GitHub Actions.
If it's private, either:
- Make it public, OR
- Upgrade to GitHub Pro for private repo Pages

### 4. Manual Workflow Trigger
If the workflow didn't run automatically:
1. Go to: https://github.com/AjaxRobinson/DZInternalTesting/actions
2. Click "Deploy static content to Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow" button

### 5. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: 404 Error
**Possible Causes:**
- Workflow hasn't completed yet (wait 2-5 minutes)
- GitHub Pages source not set to "GitHub Actions"
- Repository is private (needs upgrade or make public)
- Workflow failed to deploy

#### Issue: Blank Page
**Possible Causes:**
- JavaScript files not loading due to path issues
- Console errors (check browser dev tools)

#### Issue: Workflow Fails
**Check:**
- Node.js version compatibility
- npm dependencies issues
- Build script errors

### 6. Expected Files in Build Output
The build should create:
- `index.html` (with correct paths)
- `main.[hash].js`
- `vendors.[hash].js`
- `.nojekyll`

### 7. Timeline
- Push to main ‚Üí Workflow starts ‚Üí Build (2-3 min) ‚Üí Deploy (1-2 min) ‚Üí Site live

## Next Steps After Deployment
Once the site is live:
1. Deploy Google Apps Script backend
2. Update `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in GoogleDriveService.js
3. Test complete user flow

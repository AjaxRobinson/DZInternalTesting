# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

The issue you encountered was that GitHub Pages was trying to process your React application with Jekyll, which is not what we want for a React app.

## What was fixed:

### 1. **Disabled Jekyll Processing**
- Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent GitHub from using Jekyll
- Updated webpack to copy this file to build output

### 2. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Changed to use official GitHub Pages actions instead of third-party
- Uses proper permissions and artifact upload
- Separated build and deploy jobs for better reliability

### 3. **Improved Build Configuration**
- Added proper .gitignore files to prevent unnecessary files from being committed
- Updated webpack to handle GitHub Pages deployment properly

## Next Steps:

### 1. **Deploy Google Apps Script Backend**
You need to deploy the Google Apps Script first:

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the contents of `DrawerZen/server/main.gs`
4. Update the SPREADSHEET_ID and IMAGES_FOLDER_ID constants if needed
5. Deploy as web app:
   - Click "Deploy" → "New deployment"
   - Type: Web app
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
6. Copy the web app URL
7. Update `src/services/GoogleDriveService.js` with the actual URL (replace `YOUR_DEPLOYED_SCRIPT_ID_HERE`)

### 2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to main

### 3. **Test the Deployment**
After the GitHub Actions workflow completes:
1. Visit `https://ajaxrobinson.github.io/DZInternalTesting`
2. Test the full user flow
3. Verify data is being saved to Google Sheets

## Troubleshooting:

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** in the "Actions" tab of your repository
2. **Verify GitHub Pages settings** in repository settings
3. **Ensure the Google Apps Script is deployed** and accessible
4. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors

## Files Changed:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated deployment workflow
- ✅ `drawerzen-app/public/.nojekyll` - Disables Jekyll
- ✅ `drawerzen-app/webpack.config.js` - Copies .nojekyll to build
- ✅ `.gitignore` files - Prevents unnecessary files from being committed
- ✅ `src/services/GoogleDriveService.js` - Clearer placeholder URL

The React app should now deploy correctly to GitHub Pages without Jekyll interference!
